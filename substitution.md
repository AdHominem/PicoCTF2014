## **Problem Set**

We are given a [file](https://picoctf.com/api/autogen/serve/encrypted.txt?static=false&pid=0cffe6fd67e39c91501cb9d843984cb2) containing an encrypted authorization code.

## **Attempts**

The file seems to be song lyrics, encrypted with a substitution cipher, so I fire up [the Black Chamber](http://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/substitutioncrackingtool.html). 

## **Solution**

Using substitution the text yields THE AUTHORIZATION CODE IS MOTHERKNOWSBEST, so the flag is MOTHERKNOWSBEST.
